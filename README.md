# Prediction-Project

The file is a comma-separated file (csv) that contains n observations of p explanatory variables (labeled X1â€“Xp) and one response (Y).
This project is to develop a method for predicting Y based on X. 

The project also contains a written report of the steps I took to create my model and predictions.
